# Hyprland Dots (er1nz)

> A slightly messy collection of Hyprland configuration files and “dotfiles.”  
> Use at your own risk—if you like it, feel free to grab whatever pieces you need.

## Overview

This repository contains my personal Hyprland “dotfiles” (configuration files) for various tools and tiling/window‑manager setups. Admittedly, things here are a bit disorganized—some files date back months, some settings overlap, and you’ll likely find commented‐out bits and remnants of older experiments, you’re welcome to browse, cherry‑pick, or adapt anything.

**What’s inside:**
- `waybar/` — Custom Waybar modules and styling.
- `sherlock` or `rofi/` — Sherlock launcher, rofi themes and scripts.
- `matugen` or `pywal` - Color schemes.
- `kitty/` — Terminal (Kitty) settings and color schemes.
- `eww/` or `eww/**` — Eww widgets (if you use Eww for status bars/popups).
- `scripts/` — Helper shell or Python scripts (e.g., screenshot helpers, launcher wrappers).
- `vim/` or `nvim/` — (Minimal) Neovim/Vim customizations.
- `zsh/` — Shell prompt (fastfetch, Oh‑My‑Zsh snippets), aliases.
- `wallpapers/` — A small selection of wallpapers used in screenshots.
- `README.md` — (You’re reading it!)

> **Note:** The exact folder names and hierarchy may evolve over time. Feel free to explore and adjust to your own `$HOME/.config/` layout.

## Prerequisites

Before using these files, ensure you have a working Hyprland setup and any of the following tools installed (depending on which configs you want to use):

- **Hyprland** (≥ v1.x)  
- **Ax-Shell** (if you want the status bar configs)
- **Matugen** &/or **PyWal** (color schemes)
- **Rofi** or **Sherlock** (for launchers, power/menu scripts)  
- **Kitty** (if you use the provided `kitty.conf`)  
- **Eww** (for any Eww widgets or popups)  
- **Zsh** (and optionally fastfetch prompt)  
- **Neovim** (if adopting any `nvim/` snippets)  
- Common Unix utilities (`feh`, `lsd`, `bash`, `zsh`, `ripgrep`, etc.)

Feel free to ignore any subdirectory whose tools you don’t plan to use.
