> A slightly messy collection of Hyprland configuration files and “dotfiles.”

## Overview

This repository contains my personal Hyprland “dotfiles” (configuration files) for various tools and tiling/window‑manager setups. Admittedly, things here are a bit disorganized—some files date back months, some settings overlap, and you’ll likely find commented‐out bits and remnants of older experiments, you’re welcome to browse, cherry‑pick, or adapt anything.
